# Line following with neural network for Lego Mindstorms EV3

## Train

Use *data/.csv* to train the neural network or use *sample_collector.py* to record a track. See main method in *line_following.py* for example.

## Run

To start the ANN line following call *run* function and pass the model path. See main method in *line_following.py* for example.

Warning: if you are using a loaded model, be sure to set the L_MOTOR_BASE and R_MOTOR_BASE to the same value as displayed ("Max L/R motor") during the training phase.

## Robot

Robot related settings are in *robot.py*
